        "# **Description (English):**\n",
        "This is the core of your backend API. It uses FastAPI to receive prediction requests, preprocesses the input data using the saved preprocessor, then uses the trained model to make a prediction, and returns the result. This API will be deployed on a service like Render.\n",

        "# **الوصف (العربية):**\n",
        "هذا هو الجزء المركزي من واجهة برمجة التطبيقات (API) الخاصة بك. يستخدم إطار عمل FastAPI لاستقبال طلبات التنبؤ، ويقوم بمعالجة البيانات المدخلة باستخدام المعالج المسبق الذي تم حفظه مسبقًا، ثم يستخدم النموذج المُدرب لإجراء التنبؤ، ويعيد النتيجة. سيتم نشر هذا الـ API على خدمة مثل Render."
